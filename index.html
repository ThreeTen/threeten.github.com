        <h3>Welcome to ThreeTen</h3>

<p>The ThreeTen project is providing a new date and time API for JDK 1.8 as part of JSR-310.</p>

<h4>Main project</h4>

<p>The main strand of active development for JDK 1.8 is in <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/threeten/">OpenJDK</a>. Source code was originally located <a href="https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten">here at GitHub</a> but is now in Mercurial at OpenJDK. The issue tracker is currently still located <a href="https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten/issues">here at GitHub</a>.</p>

<h4>Backport</h4>

<p>A backport has been provided for JDK 1.7 hosted <a href="https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp">here at GitHub</a>. The backport is also available in the <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.threeten%22%20AND%20a%3A%22threetenbp%22">Maven Central repository</a>.</p>

<p>The backport <a href="http://threeten.github.com/threetenbp/apidocs">Javadoc</a> is available for browsing.</p>

<p>The backport is NOT an implementation of JSR-310, as that would involve many complex legal/procedural hoops. However, it is designed to allow an easy move from JDK 1.7 to JDK 1.8.</p>

<p>The backport is used in projects such as <a href="https://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Platform">OpenGamma</a>.</p>
