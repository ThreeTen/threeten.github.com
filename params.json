Source code was [originally located](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten) here at GitHub but is now in Mercurial at OpenJDK. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten/issues) is currently still located here at GitHub.\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\nA [backport](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp) has been provided for JDK 1.7 hosted here at GitHub. The backport is also available in the [Maven Central repository](http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g%3A%22org.threeten%22%20AND%20a%3A%22threetenbp%22).\r\n\r\nThe backport [Javadoc](http://threeten.github.com/threetenbp/apidocs) is available for browsing.\r\n\r\nThe backport is NOT an implementation of JSR-310, as that would involve many complex legal/procedural hoops. However, it is designed to allow an easy move from JDK 1.7 to JDK 1.8.\r\n\r\nThe backport is used in projects such as [OpenGamma](https://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Platform).\r\n","google":""}
